Player and computer roll a dice of the userâ€™s choice until either a 1 is rolled or a player decides to stop. 
If a 1 is rolled, the player gets 0 points, and if the player decides to stop, the player get points equal to the sum of the numbers rolled since the last 1.  
Play continues until one player has a score of 100 or more points.
